Goofy ass Racing game I made during my second year of Uni, heavily inspired by JDM and old racing games like NFS Undercover. 
The game's GAMEPLAY quality is definitely questionable, but it was an awesome way to
learn and understand ADTs, Scriptable Objects and overall better practices when writing my code. GENERICS was a big plush, 
those just allow some *chefs kiss* MODULAR ASS CODE. Also dictionaries...they are the BEST, 
genuinely solves any issues when it comes to trying to fetch data as fast as possible.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Key Features
- Epic Car racing (wink wink!)
- Highly modular player pref, you can drag it into almost any scene as long as you tag the ground...
- Fairly challenging AI racers
- Includes some of my Custom ADTs...(they're ass lmao)
- Custom Dialogue system made with Scriptable Objects (Needs rework).
- Custom Audio Crossfade (Kinda cool tbh, but needs refactoring)

## üõ† Development Setup
I solo developed this game, and had to hand model the tracks (absolute nightmare). It took about a months time (total hours combined) to "complete it",
but the last race mode is busted and I'm honestly too burnt out and lazy to fix it.
Also I forgot to add more audio tracks lmao so that thing is "bugged", but enjoy I guess.

Anyway thanks for reading my blog??? Oh! And peep one of my favorite JDM vids.
